# Project Management - ChMS

This folder contains all project management documentation for the ChMS MVP. Only essential documents for the MVP are tracked here:

- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Project Overview
- Technical Architecture
- Test Checklist
- Testing Strategy
- User Stories
- Security Policy (if relevant)

All files are updated to reflect the MVP scope:
- Organization management
- Member management
- Attendance (QR/offline/search)
- Minimal reporting

Legacy and non-MVP features have been removed or archived. All new work and planning should reference only these MVP documents.
