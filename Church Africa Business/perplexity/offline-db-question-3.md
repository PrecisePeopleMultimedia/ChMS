what if we build this as a plugin they can buy and use? and the plugin will require online synce compulsorily with dropbox, google drive, icloud, etc with an option to add admin users. Meaning, if you are added as an admin to the backup, you will be prompted to login anywhere you access the platform and will be prompted to download the copy of the backup before the platform will setup on the system, even though it is browser based. We can figure out modalities later like admin or something. the plugin can be subscription based for a small amount of money or one time purchase for a large amount of money (maybe not good for business?). And can we build and integrate this post mvp, so we can keep it for future plan instead of being distracted by it now?
