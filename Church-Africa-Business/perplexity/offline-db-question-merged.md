# Offline Database Mode - Consolidated Question

## The Wild Idea

I had this wild idea about offering organizations an offline data mode using SQLite on their local PC with strict instructions on how to manage it. This would mean their data would not be on our website/database/server, but on their designated PC (or even Google Drive or any online platform that would be easy to integrate with).

## Key Questions

1. **Is this technically feasible?** How complex is this approach?
2. **Why don't companies offer this?** What are the business/engineering barriers?
3. **When should we implement this?** MVP or post-MVP? (I'm thinking MVP)
4. **What's wrong with this idea?** From engineering, business, and other perspectives I might be missing

## The Vision

- Lock this functionality behind a paywall
- Use it as a marketing strategy: "You are in control of your data"
- We only collect the number of members the organization has, and some metrics, but not the member details
- This option would be set in the setup stage so we can decide on where their database will be
- If they later decide to have the data on our server, they would need to go through the setup again

## Alignment with Values

This approach aligns with our values of transparency and not being a profit-first organization. It addresses real concerns about data privacy and sovereignty that many organizations have.

## Need for Honest Assessment

I need you to keep me real and not just fantasizing on a bad or poor engineering decision or poor business decision. What are the real challenges, risks, and considerations I should be aware of?
