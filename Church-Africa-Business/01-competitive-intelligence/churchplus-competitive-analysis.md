- **Geographic focus** on specific countries/regions
- **Price-sensitive segment** with superior value proposition

#### **2. Realistic Feature Prioritization**
- **Match core functionality** first (member management, basic communication)
- **Add AI features** only after proving core value proposition
- **Focus on mobile experience** as key differentiator
- **Offline capability** as secondary feature

#### **3. Go-to-Market Strategy**
- **Partner with church networks** for credibility and distribution
- **Freemium model** to reduce switching barriers
- **Focus on user experience** as primary differentiator

## **🔍 CONCLUSION: REALISTIC ASSESSMENT**

### **Potential Path Forward**
1. **Start with MVP** focused on core church management needs
2. **Target underserved segments** rather than competing head-to-head
3. **Focus on user experience** and mobile-first design as differentiators
4. **Build gradually** rather than trying to match all features immediately
5. **Consider partnership** or white-label opportunities with ChurchPlus

### **Key Success Factors**
- **Execution excellence** in core features
- **Superior user experience** that justifies switching
- **Strong customer support** from day one
