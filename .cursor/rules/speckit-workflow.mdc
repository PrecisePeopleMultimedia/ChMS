# Spec-Kit Workflow Rule

## ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SPEC-KIT WAY

This project uses GitHub Spec-Kit for specification-driven development. **ALWAYS** follow the proper Spec-Kit workflow sequence:

### Required Workflow Sequence

1. **`/specify`** - Define what to build (requirements and user stories)
   - Creates `specs/XXX-feature-name/spec.md`
   - Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
   - No technical implementation details

2. **`/clarify`** - Clarify underspecified areas 
   - **MUST be run before `/plan` unless explicitly skipped**
   - Interactive Q&A to resolve ambiguities
   - Updates spec.md with clarifications

3. **`/plan`** - Create technical implementation plans
   - Creates `specs/XXX-feature-name/plan.md`
   - Define tech stack, architecture, structure
   - High-level implementation approach

4. **`/tasks`** - Generate actionable task lists
   - Creates `specs/XXX-feature-name/tasks.md`
   - Break plan into executable tasks
   - Include dependencies and parallel execution

5. **`/analyze`** - Cross-artifact consistency & coverage analysis
   - Run after `/tasks`, before `/implement`
   - Validate consistency across specs, plans, tasks

6. **`/implement`** - Execute all tasks to build the feature
   - Follow the tasks.md step by step
   - Update task checkboxes as work is completed

### Critical Rules

- **NEVER skip the `/plan` step** - it's required before `/tasks`
- **NEVER go straight to implementation** without completing the workflow
- **ALWAYS create plan.md before tasks.md**
- **ALWAYS update task checkboxes** in tasks.md as work progresses
- **ALWAYS follow the proper file structure**: `specs/XXX-feature-name/`

### File Structure

```
.specify/
└── specs/
    └── XXX-feature-name/
        ├── spec.md          # Created by /specify
        ├── plan.md          # Created by /plan
        ├── tasks.md         # Created by /tasks
        └── implementation-details/  # Optional detailed docs
```

### Reminder Message

**USE THE SPEC-KIT WAY** - Always follow the proper workflow sequence. Don't skip steps or go straight to implementation.
