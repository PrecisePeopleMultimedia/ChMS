# Mandatory AI Self-Reflection Workflow

## COMPULSORY WORKFLOW - NO EXCEPTIONS

### Before Starting ANY Complex Task:

#### 1. CREATE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MANDATORY)
```
- [ ] Define specific, measurable success criteria
- [ ] Identify validation checkpoints
- [ ] Establish "done" definition
- [ ] Create task breakdown if complex
```

#### 2. DOCUMENT APPROACH (MANDATORY)
```
- [ ] Outline methodology
- [ ] Identify potential failure points
- [ ] Plan validation steps
- [ ] Set quality gates
```

#### 3. EXECUTION WITH CHECKPOINTS (MANDATORY)
```
- [ ] Validate at each checkpoint
- [ ] Document progress against criteria
- [ ] Course-correct if needed
- [ ] Gather evidence of completion
```

#### 4. FINAL VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
```
- [ ] Test actual functionality (not assumptions)
- [ ] Verify each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Provide evidence of completion
- [ ] Acknowledge any limitations or gaps
```

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Technical Enforcement:
- Use task management tools to create acceptance criteria
- Break complex work into validated subtasks
- Require evidence before claiming completion

### User Validation:
- User must approve acceptance criteria before work begins
- User validates completion against criteria
- User provides feedback on compliance

### Compliance Tracking:
- Document all self-reflection workflows
- Track compliance patterns
- Adjust rules based on failures

## FAILURE CONSEQUENCES

### If AI Skips Self-Reflection:
- Work is considered incomplete
- Must restart with proper workflow
- User should reject deliverables
- Update rules to prevent recurrence

### If AI Claims Completion Without Validation:
- Immediate quality review required
- Evidence must be provided retroactively
- User should challenge assumptions
- Implement additional checkpoints

## EXAMPLES

### Good Self-Reflection:
```
TASK: Update organization URLs
CRITERIA: 
- [ ] Find ALL references (not just obvious ones)
- [ ] Search multiple file types (.vue, .md, .js, etc.)
- [ ] Verify with multiple search methods
- [ ] Test final result
VALIDATION: Comprehensive search + user verification
RESULT: Found 5 files, user caught 2 I missed
```

### Bad Self-Reflection:
```
TASK: Update organization URLs
APPROACH: Quick search and replace
VALIDATION: Assumed search was complete
RESULT: Missed 2 files, user had to fix
```

## REMEMBER

**AI COMPLIANCE IS NOT GUARANTEED**
- This rule file helps but doesn't ensure compliance
- User vigilance is essential
- Technical enforcement is more reliable than behavioral rules
- Regular auditing and feedback are crucial

**USER RESPONSIBILITY**
- Demand acceptance criteria before complex work
- Validate AI claims against evidence
- Provide feedback on compliance failures
- Don't accept "trust me" from AI systems
