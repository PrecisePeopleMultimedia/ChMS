# ChMS - Claude AI Integration Guide

## Project Overview
ChMS (Church Management System) is an Africa-first, offline-capable church management solution built with Vue 3, Laravel, and Supabase. This project follows spec-driven development principles with a focus on minimalist, reliable functionality.

## Available Slash Commands

### /constitution
Create or update project governing principles and development guidelines.

**Usage:** `/constitution Create principles focused on Africa-first development, code quality, testing standards, and performance requirements`

### /specify
Define what you want to build (requirements and user stories).

**Usage:** `/specify Build a member management system that allows churches to add, edit, and search for members offline, with automatic sync when online`

### /clarify
Clarify underspecified areas (must be run before /plan unless explicitly skipped).

**Usage:** `/clarify` (interactive process to clarify requirements)

### /plan
Create technical implementation plans with your chosen tech stack.

**Usage:** `/plan Implement using Laravel 11 backend with RESTful APIs, Vue 3 frontend with Composition API, and Quasar Framework for UI components`

### /tasks
Generate actionable task lists for implementation.

**Usage:** `/tasks` (generates detailed task breakdown from implementation plan)

### /analyze
Cross-artifact consistency & coverage analysis (run after /tasks, before /implement).

**Usage:** `/analyze` (validates consistency across specifications, plans, and tasks)

### /implement
Execute all tasks to build the feature according to the plan.

**Usage:** `/implement` (executes the implementation plan step by step)

## Africa-First Principles

### Technical Constraints
- **Bundle size**: Keep JavaScript bundles under 500KB
- **Load time**: < 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Offline-first**: All core features work without internet
- **Mobile-first**: Optimized for Android devices
- **Low bandwidth**: Minimal data usage and smart caching

### Design Principles
- **Simple UI**: Intuitive for users with varying technical skills
- **Touch-friendly**: Large buttons, gesture support
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works on older devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance
- **Material Design**: Familiar UI patterns via Quasar Framework

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development Process
1. **Constitution**: Establish or review project principles
2. **Specify**: Define feature requirements and user stories
3. **Clarify**: Address any unclear requirements
4. **Plan**: Create technical implementation plan
5. **Tasks**: Break down into actionable tasks
6. **Analyze**: Validate consistency and coverage
7. **Implement**: Execute the implementation plan

### 2. Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript/PHP strict mode**: Type safety enforcement
- **ESLint/PHP-CS-Fixer**: Code formatting and style
- **Test-driven development**: Write tests first
- **Code reviews**: All changes require peer review
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline and README docs

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests (Vitest)**: 85%+ coverage for critical paths
- **Integration tests**: API and component integration
- **E2E tests (Playwright)**: Complete user workflows
- **Regression tests (Playwright)**: Automated regression testing
- **Mobile testing**: Test on target Android devices
- **Offline testing**: Verify offline functionality
