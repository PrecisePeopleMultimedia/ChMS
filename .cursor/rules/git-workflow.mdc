# Git Workflow Rules - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

## 🚨 CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

### **MANDATORY BRANCH FLOW**
```
feat/feature-name → dev → main
```

**NEVER commit directly to main except for:**
- Initial project setup
- Critical hotfixes (with explicit user permission)
- Documentation-only changes (specs, README)

### **BRANCH NAMING CONVENTION**
- **Feature branches**: `feat/feature-name` or `feature/feature-name`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/issue-description`
- **Release branches**: `release/version-number`

### **MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS**

#### 1. **Feature Development**
```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/feature-name

# Work on feature
# ... make changes ...

# Commit to feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin feat/feature-name
```

#### 2. **Testing Phase**
```bash
# Merge to dev for testing
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git merge feat/feature-name
git push origin dev

# Test thoroughly on dev branch
# Fix any issues on feature branch, then re-merge to dev
```

#### 3. **Production Release**
```bash
# Only after successful testing on dev
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge dev
git push origin main

# Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feat/feature-name
git push origin --delete feat/feature-name
```

### **PULL REQUEST WORKFLOW**
1. **feat/feature-name → dev** (for testing)
2. **dev → main** (for production release)

### **NEVER DO THESE**
- ❌ Direct commits to main (except documented exceptions)
- ❌ Direct merges from feat → main (must go through dev)
- ❌ Force pushes to main or dev branches
- ❌ Rewriting history on shared branches
- ❌ Merging untested code to main

### **BRANCH STATUS VERIFICATION**

Before any merge, ALWAYS verify:
```bash
# Check branch status
git branch -a

# Verify main is clean
git log --oneline main -5

# Verify feature branch is ahead of main
git log --oneline main..feat/feature-name

# Verify no unintended commits on main
git log --oneline feat/feature-name..main
```

### **COMMIT MESSAGE STANDARDS**

Follow conventional commits:
```
feat: add new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation changes
style: formatting changes
refactor: code refactoring
test: adding tests
chore: maintenance tasks
```

### **DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

Every feature branch must include:
- [ ] Updated specs (if applicable)
- [ ] Updated tasks.md with completion status
- [ ] Updated TODO.md (if applicable)
- [ ] Proper commit messages following conventional commits
- [ ] Testing evidence (unit, integration, E2E)

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

- **Zero direct commits to main** (except documented exceptions)
- **100% feature branch compliance**
- **All features tested on dev before main**
- **Clean git history with proper workflow**
- **No broken builds on main branch**

**REMEMBER: This workflow protects our production code and ensures quality. NEVER bypass these rules without explicit permission and documentation.**
